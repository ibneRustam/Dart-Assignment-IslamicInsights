# Dart-Assignment-IslamicInsights
First Task of Mobile app development in Dart


**Assignment Introduction:**

This is my first assignment in Dart programming language, which I am completing on the exact day of Eid in March 2025(1446 hijri), as it is our holiday task and must be completed in three days. The assignment consists of seven different tasks, all of which are based on Dart language.

**1st Task Variables and Data Types:**  
The first task involves using variables to provide a brief introduction to the five pillars of Islam. The concept is represented using Dart variables, where each of the five pillars (Shahada, Salah, Zakat, Sawm, and Hajj) is introduced with a short description.


**2nd Task Arithmetic Operators:**  
In the second task, we used **Arithmetic Operators** to create two formulas:  
a: **Zakat Calculation Formula:**  
   In this formula, you enter your total amount of money, and the program will determine whether Zakat is obligatory or not. If Zakat is due, the formula will calculate how much Zakat should be based on your total amount.  
b: **Fidya or Sadaqat al-Fitr Calculation:**  
   This formula allows you to input the number of fasting individuals, and it will calculate the required amount of Sadaqat al-Fitr or Fidya for each, based on the type of food (dates, raisins, barley, or wheat).


**3rd Task Conditional Statements - If/Else :**
The third task uses **Conditional Statements - If/Else** to ask the user how many prayers they have offered. If they have offered all the prayers, they are praised, and if they have missed some, they are encouraged to offer more prayers with a prayer for them.


**4th Task Conditional Statements - Switch Case:**  
In the fourth task, **Conditional Statements - Switch Case** is used to print a short message for each day of the week. The user can input the day in any format (either in English or Urdu, using lowercase, uppercase, or mixed case), and the program will display a specific message corresponding to that day.


**5th Task For Loop:**  
In the fifth task, **For Loop** is used to print the 99 names of Allah (Asma Ul Husna) in order.


**6th Task While Loop:**
In this task, we created a program that continuously asks the user about the Quranic verses they have memorized. The program will keep asking until the user presses the "exit" button, at which point the program will stop.

**Bonus Task:**
In the bonus task, you can determine the Qibla direction for any city. The process is very simple: to find the Qibla direction for a city or country, the user will provide the latitude and longitude of that city or country. The program will then give the direction of the Qibla for that location.
